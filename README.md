These are my solutions to [advent of code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).
I will use some different languages over the month. Some that I already know, but also some new ones I've wanted to learn.
Feel free to have a look around the solutions if you are interested!

## Languages

Here is a list of languages I would like to use during Advent of Code:

- [x] Rust
- [x] Python 
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Clojure
- [x] C
- [x] Lua
- [ ] Assembly (we will see if I want to do this to myself xD)
- [x] Scala
- [ ] Bash
- [ ] JavaScript (maybe, don't really enjoy this language tbh)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to try out my solutions, you will have to add an `inputs` folder to the root directory with the input for each day named 01.txt, 02.txt, etc..
